## üìã Prototype Demo Preparation

### Demo Path 1: New Student Experience
1. Start at home screen
2. Search for "Computer Science Building"
3. View building details and bookmark
4. Navigate to schedule view
5. Show class location on map

### Demo Path 2: Daily Campus Navigation
1. Start at home screen
2. View today's schedule
3. Locate next class on map
4. Toggle to indoor navigation
5. Show floor selection

### Demo Path 3: Accessibility Features
1. Show language switching (English to Hindi)
2. Demonstrate dark mode
3. Show text size adjustment
4. Demonstrate screen reader compatibility

## üìù Known Limitations to Communicate

- Indoor navigation is simulated (Wi-Fi positioning not implemented)
- No backend integration (using mock data)
- Limited device testing (specify which devices were tested)
